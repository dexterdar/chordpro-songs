[G]God's building a church
It's gonna [C]march like a mighty [G]army man
God's building a church
It'll be water to the dry and barren land
God's building a church
It's gonna rise from a valley of dead dry bones
Sanctified
Glorified
Filled with the holy ghosts power and might
Purified with fire divine
God's building a church
