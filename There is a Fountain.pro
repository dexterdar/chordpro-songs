Th[G]ere is a foun-tain [C]filled with bl[G]ood Drawn from Im-[G]man-uelâ€™s ve[D]ins;

{c:Chorus 1:}
Lose [G]all their guilt-y st[C]ains, Lose [G]all their guilt-y st[D]ains;

{c:Chorus 2:}
Wash [G]all my   sins    a-[C]way,  Wash  a[G]ll  my   sins   a - [D]way;

E'er s[G]ince by faith  I  [C]saw the  s[G]tream  Thy fl[G]ow-ing wounds su[D]p-ply,
Re -[G]deem- ing love has b[C]een  my   t[G]heme,  And  shall  be   t[D]ill  I  [G]die;

{c:Chorus 4:}
And [G] shall  be  till  I [C]die,  And  s[G]hall  be  till  I    [D]die;
Re -[G]deem- ing love has [C]been  my   t[G]heme,  And  sh[G]all  be   t[D]ill  I  d[G]ie.
